# communitymapp

communitymapp is the name of our repo for the ValleyGuard web application using AWS. 

# Description

The application uses AWS Location Services to display and output locations of reported incidents. Incidents can be filed on the FORM page of the website.

## Dependencies

We are using Serverless Lambda Functions via API Gateways to access and 
get/post data to a small DynamoDB database. The code for the AWS services 
is not included in this repo; contact Jack for more info about that.

Besides AWS services, all of our code is written in plain and native js, 
css, and html. There's a random flask package installed for some reason - 
its the glue of the project. The application doesn't run without the _pycache_ folder. 
nobody knows why.
